Sample Student is a PhD candidate at the Department of Computer Science, University of Beira Interior, working under the supervision of Prof. João C. Neves and co-supervision of Prof. Hugo Proença.

His research focuses on developing novel deep learning architectures for biometric recognition in challenging environments. His work combines advanced computer vision techniques with state-of-the-art neural network designs to achieve robust recognition across various sensing conditions.

Sample has published papers in recognized conferences such as CVPR and ICCV, and journals including IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence. He is particularly interested in multimodal biometric fusion and attention mechanisms for improving recognition accuracy.

Before joining the Socia-Lab, Sample received his Master's degree in Computer Science from the Technical University of Lisbon, where he specialized in artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches for image analysis.
