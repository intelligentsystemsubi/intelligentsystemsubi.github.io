Joana Costa is a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Beira Interior, working under the supervision of Prof. Hugo Proença. Her research focuses on applying deep learning techniques to solve challenging problems in ocular biometrics, particularly in unconstrained environments.

Prior to joining the Socia-Lab, Joana completed her MSc in Computer Science at the University of Porto, where she worked on face recognition systems. She has professional experience as a software engineer, which provides her with a practical perspective on implementing computer vision solutions.

Her current research addresses the gaps in ocular recognition systems when dealing with poor-quality images, occlusion, and varying illumination conditions. She is exploring novel network architectures that combine attention mechanisms with adversarial learning to improve feature extraction and matching accuracy.

Joana has published several papers in international conferences and journals. She has also been actively involved in teaching, serving as a teaching assistant for undergraduate courses in Programming and Computer Vision.
