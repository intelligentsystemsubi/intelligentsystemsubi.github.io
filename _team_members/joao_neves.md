João C. Neves is an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science, University of Beira Interior and a researcher at the SOCIA Lab. His research focuses on computer vision, pattern recognition, and machine learning techniques for biometric recognition and visual surveillance.

He has published extensively in top-tier international journals and conferences, including IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, and IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security.

His current projects involve developing advanced deep learning architectures for person re-identification, face recognition in surveillance environments, and multimodal biometric systems. He collaborates with international research groups and has served as a reviewer for major journals and conferences in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition.

## Research Focus

Prof. Neves' work spans several key areas in computer vision and biometrics:

1. **Person Re-identification**: Developing algorithms that can identify the same person across different camera views, which is crucial for surveillance and security applications.

2. **Face Recognition in Unconstrained Environments**: Creating robust systems that can recognize faces in challenging conditions such as poor lighting, partial occlusions, or extreme poses.

3. **Multimodal Biometric Systems**: Combining multiple biometric traits (face, iris, fingerprint) to improve recognition accuracy and robustness.

4. **Deep Learning for Visual Analysis**: Applying and adapting deep neural network architectures for various computer vision tasks, with a focus on representation learning.

## Teaching

At the University of Beira Interior, Prof. Neves teaches several courses related to his expertise:

- Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
- Computer Vision
- Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning
- Advanced Topics in Biometrics

He has supervised numerous Master's and PhD students who have gone on to successful careers in both academia and industry.

## International Collaboration

Prof. Neves maintains active collaborations with researchers from institutions worldwide, including:

- University of Notre Dame, USA
- Technical University of Madrid, Spain
- University of Sassari, Italy
- Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

These collaborations have resulted in joint publications, research visits, and shared datasets that have advanced the state of the art in biometric recognition.
