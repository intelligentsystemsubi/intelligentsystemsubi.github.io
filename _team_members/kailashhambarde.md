Dr. Kailash A. Hambarde is a Post-Doctoral Researcher specializing in 3D computer vision and neural rendering. He completed his Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2022, focusing on neural representations for dynamic scenes.

At Socia-Lab, Kailash leads research on efficient neural scene representations for augmented reality applications. His work combines classical computer vision techniques with modern deep learning approaches to enable real-time scene understanding and rendering on mobile devices.

Prior to joining Socia-Lab, Kailash worked as a research scientist at a leading AR/VR company, where he developed algorithms for depth estimation and scene reconstruction. His research has been published in top venues including CVPR, ICCV, and SIGGRAPH.

Kailash actively collaborates with industry partners to transition academic research into practical applications. He is particularly interested in making advanced computer vision technologies accessible on resource-constrained devices and bridging the gap between academic research and real-world deployment.
