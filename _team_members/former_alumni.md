Former Alumni was a PhD researcher at the SOCIA Lab from 2016 to 2021, working under the supervision of Prof. Hugo Proença and co-supervision of Prof. João C. Neves. Her dissertation, titled "Robust Deep Learning Architectures for Biometric Recognition in Adversarial Environments," focused on developing novel defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks on biometric systems.

During her time at SOCIA Lab, she published over 15 papers in top-tier conferences and journals, including IEEE TPAMI, CVPR, and ICCV. Her work on adversarial training for face recognition systems received the Best Paper Award at the International Conference on Biometrics (ICB) in 2019.

## Key Contributions

Her research made several key contributions to the field:

1. Development of a novel adversarial training framework specifically designed for biometric recognition systems
2. Introduction of a detection mechanism for identifying morphed facial images with state-of-the-art accuracy
3. Creation of a benchmark dataset for evaluating the robustness of face recognition systems against various types of physical and digital attacks

## Current Position

After completing her PhD, Former joined Google AI Research in Zurich, where she continues to work on robust machine learning algorithms for computer vision applications. She maintains collaboration with SOCIA Lab through joint research projects and co-supervision of PhD students.

## Awards and Recognition
