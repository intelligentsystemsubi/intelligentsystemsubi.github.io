Former Alumni was a researcher at the Intelligent Systems Laboratory from 2015 to 2021. During this time, they contributed to several projects in computer vision and deep learning for biometric applications.

After completing their research at IS-UBI, they joined the AI Research Institute at the University of Excellence, where they currently lead research on advanced computer vision techniques.

Their work at IS-UBI resulted in multiple publications in top-tier conferences and journals, and they continue to collaborate with the lab on joint research projects.

## Key Contributions

Her research made several key contributions to the field:

1. Development of a novel adversarial training framework specifically designed for biometric recognition systems
2. Introduction of a detection mechanism for identifying morphed facial images with state-of-the-art accuracy
3. Creation of a benchmark dataset for evaluating the robustness of face recognition systems against various types of physical and digital attacks

## Current Position

After completing her PhD, Former joined Google AI Research in Zurich, where she continues to work on robust machine learning algorithms for computer vision applications. She maintains collaboration with SOCIA Lab through joint research projects and co-supervision of PhD students.
