# Projects

This directory is no longer used for storing individual project files.

## New Data-Driven Approach

Instead of creating individual markdown files in this directory, all projects are now defined in the `_data/projects.yml` file. This approach makes it easier to:

1. Manage all projects in one place
2. Standardize project information
3. Automatically generate individual project pages based on the data

## How to Add a New Project

To add a new project, edit the `_data/projects.yml` file following the structure defined there. Each project with an `id` field will automatically get its own page at `/projects/[id]/`.

See the main README.md file for detailed instructions on adding new projects.
