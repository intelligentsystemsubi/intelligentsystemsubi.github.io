  description: "A comprehensive benchmark dataset built for real-world, long-range human recognition. It supports key computer vision tasks like person detection, re-identification (ReID), multi-view tracking, and action recognition — all captured in complex outdoor scenes using drones and ground cameras."
  key_features:
    - "Long-Range Person Recognition"
    - "Aerial and Ground Views"
    - "18 UAV Viewpoints"
    - "120m Max Altitude"
    - "7 Collection Sites"

  description: "A fully annotated multi-session dataset for Pedestrian Detection, Tracking, Re-identification (REID) and Search from aerial devices. It contains data for 253 identities, over 2 sessions (clothing/appearance changes), with 18 viewpoints per identity, acquired by drones flying at various altitudes, with pitch angles and lighting conditions."
  key_features:
    - "253 Identities"
    - "10+ Soft-Biometrics"
    - "2 Sessions (with appearance changes)"
    - "18 viewpoints per identity"
    - "Variable altitude (20-40m)"
